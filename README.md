# Simple FTP Client with GUI


### What is it?

  The Simple FTP Client with GUI is my semestral project 
  written in C++ with ncurses library. Initial commit is the
  final version, which I handed in at the Faculty of Information
  Technology, Czech Technical University in Prague. Client can do 
  following commands: browsing directories on a FTP server, 
  renaming files and folders, recursive uploading from a local 
  directory, recursive downloading from a server, making new 
  directories and recursive deleting on a server.
